# CS165-FINAL
## This is the final project for CS165 (Software Deelopment Tools) at Luther College. 

--- "Your final project is to write a Python Shell program that reads either from standard input
or from a fileand counts the lines, words, and characters of a file." ---

Python must be installed and available at the location specified in your pywc script.

To run this, go to your command prompt and type in pywc followed by the filename.

You should do chmod +x pywc  that you can exucute the program.
